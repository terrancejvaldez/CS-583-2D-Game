FIRE GAME

Description: You are a (fire)fighter and need to dodge a bunch of fire obstacles until you get hit and die an unfortunate death. 

How to Play: The controls are W to jump, A to move left, D to move right, and S to duck down. 
The green blob that appears on screen is my attempt at making an H2O molecule and this extinguishes all of the fire on the screen.

Objective: Do not get hit for as long as you can. The score is a stopwatch and is saved after the player gets hit by a fire obstacle. 

Note: 
I used two asset packs from the unity asset store and I did not bother to get rid of the sprite that I did not use, so I uploaded them all to this github repo. 
This game aims to promote awareness of the dangers of fires and is a tribute to the fire that happened on Fairmount Ave. and Montezuma Rd.
